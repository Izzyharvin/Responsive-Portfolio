                    <p>I am an artist that likes creativity. When it comes to Technology I also love seeing new inventions that people have created. Having those two togther as a interest and talent I want to create something of my own, even if it's for another company. Just thinking about what I have learn to create something out of nothing brings joy. <br><br>
                    I have the dedication to build and creative to make something useful for people or even entertainment. Also, I'm always ready to improve on my skills and to learn more.
